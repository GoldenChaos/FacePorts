# FacePorts

Clockology ports of all the watch faces that Apple withholds from certain watch models. More faces will be added over time.

Use these faces frequently? Feel free to buy me a coffee: https://paypal.me/goldenchaos

# Latest Release: [FacePorts v1.0](https://github.com/GoldenChaos/FacePorts/releases/download/v1.0/All_Faces_42mm.zip)

# How to Use
1. Download [Clockology]() from the App Store.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/GoldenChaos/FacePorts/releases/download/v1.0/All_Faces_42mm.zip) of FacePorts and unzip to the Clockology iCloud Drive folder.
2. In your watch's settings, under `General > Wake Screen`, make sure `Return to Clock` is set to `After Crown Press`. *On watchOS 7 and higher, this setting can be enabled for just the Clockology app.*
3. With the Clockology watch app open, open the included [_EnableBeta.clock](https://github.com/GoldenChaos/FacePorts/releases/download/v1.0/_EnableBeta.clock) with Clockology on your iPhone. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable Watch Sync.
4. Select the FacePort .clock files you want to sync to your watch and tap "Watch Sync".
5. With the watch app open, tap "Sync" on your iPhone. This can take a little bit depending on how many faces you are syncing at once. Try to keep both your watch and iPhone awake during the entire sync.
6. To change dials or complications, simply edit the face using Clockology. There are tons of additional dials and complications on every face that you can enable/disable!
